This is team Third Dimension Coding's project titled A Walk Through Code.

To create and run our project we used the Unity3D game engine; the folder attached to this GitHub is a Unity project. We installed several plug-ins that you will also need if you want to run the game. They are SteamVR, ProBuilder, and TextMeshPro. The hardware required to run the game is a computer capable of running virtual reality and an HTC Vive (both the headset and the sensors). You will also need Steam installed on your computer in order to set up and calibrate the VR system.
